and pull request.

## Code Formatting

Code formatting support provided by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

```shell
make format
```

Alternatively, you can check if the code is already formatted correctly by executing the lint job instead.

```shell
make lint
```

## Test

Tested using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), using test cases defined in the `src/` directory matching `*.spec.ts` pattern.

```shell
make test
```

Our test suite contains the following kinds of tests:

-   **Unit** - Does each unit of code perform its intended purpose, and do we handle potential error cases correctly.
-   **Integration** - Can our plugin be loaded into PostCSS and then executed correctly.
-   **Acceptance** - Does our plugin perform the correct operations based on provided configuration.
